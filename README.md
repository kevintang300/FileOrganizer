Created by: **Kevin Tang**

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Iterate through folder
* [x] Interpret file types
* [x] Move files to proper folders

To be Optimized:

* [ ] Path's are static, create program in a way where anyone can use the script.
* [ ] Duplicate files should be dealt with properly 
* [ ] Creating a directory dynamically will cause the loop to read the newly created directory as well, make sure to store filenames in an array first.
